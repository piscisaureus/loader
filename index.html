      # About the script type

      The `script type` attribute is set to "denodule" here; the loader service
      will change the type to "module" later.

      This is not a very critical or important part of the design however. It
      works around the problem that Chrome tries to fully resolve the module
      tree for 'service/init.js' and 'app1|2.js' as a single unit. Since
      'app1|2.js' depend on the loader service to be available, fully loading
      the module tree doesn't succeed; subsequently Chrome doesn't even run
      'service/init.js', and we're stuck.

      An alternative solution is to use `type="module"` as usual, while also
      adding the `async` attribute, like this:
      ```
      <script type="module" src="app1.js" async></script>
      ```
    -->
    <script type="denodule" src="app1.js"></script>
    <script type="denodule" src="app2.js"></script>
